# party-ouija
A little ouija program with custom responses. Made to add a little flair to a Halloween party.

Code runs a simple check for yes/no interrogatives and provides a randomized response. Has a purposely non-robust profanity filter, with some added visual jazz when the ouija ghost gets mad.

This was a rush job, so file structure is a bit wonky. Board responses can be set in the responses.gd script (should probably be a json or csv, but this is quick and formats nicely in the editor - sue me).
